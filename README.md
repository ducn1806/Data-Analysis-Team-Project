# Data Analysis Team Project for Southern and Eastern Africa

Collaborated with students to conduct an analysis utilizing data from World Bank for a specific region
Worked on the coding and the analysis to pick a country from that region to represent it on average and see what makes it unique compared to the rest of the world
